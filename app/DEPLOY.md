# CodeGraph — Deployment & Operations

Production runbook for the CodeGraph product app.

## Requirements
- **Node ≥ 22** (uses the built-in `node:sqlite` — no native modules).
- **git** on PATH at runtime (clones public repos).
- Writable `./data` directory (SQLite + WAL).

## Run modes

### Local dev
```bash
cd CodeGraph/app
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4000
```

### Production (standalone Node)
```bash
npm run build        # emits .next/standalone/server.js (output: "standalone")
npm run start        # next start -p 4000
```

### Docker (recommended)
```bash
cd CodeGraph/app
docker compose up --build          # http://localhost:4000
```
- Multi-stage build on `node:24-slim`; runtime image includes `git`.
- Runs as **root** — deliberately; see `docs/postmortems/2026-07-10-render-crash-loop.md`. A platform-mounted persistent disk (Render) doesn't inherit the image's baked-in ownership and can reset to root on every restart; dropping privileges after fixing ownership (`setpriv`) crash-looped because Render doesn't grant `CAP_SETUID`. Running as root sidesteps the whole class of problem.
- SQLite persists to the named volume `codegraph-data` (`/app/data`).
- `HEALTHCHECK` polls `/api/health`.

## Configuration (env)
| Var | Where | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | website build + GitHub OAuth callback | `https://app.codegraph.dev` | Marketing "Start Indexing" target; also the base URL used to build the OAuth `redirect_uri` (falls back to the request's own origin if unset) |
| `PORT` | app runtime | `4000` | HTTP port |
| `HOSTNAME` | app runtime | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address (Docker) |
| `CG_MAX_FILES` | app runtime | `4000` | Max files scanned per repo |
| `CG_CLONE_TIMEOUT_MS` | app runtime | `90000` | git clone timeout |
| `CG_DATA_DIR` | app runtime | `./data` | SQLite location |
| `CG_ALLOW_LOCAL_ACCESS` | app runtime | unset (= off in production) | Opt in to local-folder indexing + server-side folder browsing on a public deployment. Only set `true` on a trusted, single-operator host. |
| `CG_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | app runtime | unset (= off) | Gate the whole app behind HTTP Basic Auth. Pairs with `CG_BASIC_AUTH_USER` (default `codegraph`). |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | app runtime | unset (= GitHub sign-in hidden) | From a GitHub OAuth App — see below. |
| `CG_SESSION_SECRET` | app runtime | unset (= GitHub sign-in disabled) | Encrypts the GitHub session cookie (AES-256-GCM). Required alongside the two vars above for GitHub sign-in to activate. Any long random string; rotating it signs everyone out. |
| `CG_OWNER_GITHUB_LOGIN` | app runtime | unset (= no owner-lock) | Restrict the **entire app** — every page and API route, including the normally-anonymous public bucket — to one or more GitHub logins (comma-separated, case-insensitive). Requires GitHub sign-in to be fully configured too (fails closed with a 500 otherwise). See below. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | app runtime | unset (= Claude AI Assistant hidden) | Enables the Editor tab's AI Assistant using Claude (Claude Agent SDK) — see below. Core product features never need this. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | app runtime | unset | Alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: authenticates Claude via a Pro/Max/Team subscription login instead of pay-per-token API billing. The only way subscription mode can work on a hosted/container deployment (no persistent home directory, no interactive terminal for `claude login`) — see below. |
| `CG_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` | app runtime | unset (= local-model AI Assistant hidden) | Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp `server`, vLLM, …), e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`. Required alongside `CG_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` — see below. |
| `CG_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` | app runtime | unset | Model name/tag to request from that endpoint, e.g. `qwen2.5-coder:7b`. Required alongside `CG_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL`. |
| `CG_LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY` | app runtime | unset (sends `local`) | Optional bearer token if your local server's endpoint requires one; most (Ollama, LM Studio) don't. |
| `CG_LOCAL_ACCESS_ROOT` | app runtime | unset (= unrestricted once `CG_ALLOW_LOCAL_ACCESS` is on) | Defense-in-depth: when set, confines `/api/browse` and local-folder indexing to descendants of this directory even if `CG_ALLOW_LOCAL_ACCESS=true`, so a local-access misconfiguration can't expose the whole filesystem. |
| `CG_FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES` | app runtime | unset (= derived from the request) | Override the session/OAuth cookies' `Secure` flag. Normally derived from `x-forwarded-proto`/the request's own scheme, not `NODE_ENV` — only set this if your proxy doesn't forward that header reliably. |

## GitHub sign-in setup (optional)
Lets a signed-in user browse and one-click import their own repos — including private ones — instead of pasting a URL. Fully optional and off by default; skip this section if you don't need it.

1. **Register a GitHub OAuth App**: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → [OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) → **New OAuth App**.
   - **Homepage URL**: your deployment's public URL (e.g. `https://codegraph-8qqc.onrender.com`).
   - **Authorization callback URL**: that same URL + `/api/auth/github/callback` (e.g. `https://codegraph-8qqc.onrender.com/api/auth/github/callback`) — must match exactly, including scheme.
   - For local dev too, either register a second OAuth App with callback `http://localhost:4000/api/auth/github/callback`, or just reuse one app and update its callback URL when switching between local and deployed testing.
2. Copy the **Client ID**, and generate + copy a **Client Secret**.
3. Set three env vars on the deployment (and/or in a local `.env.local` for dev):
   ```bash
   GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<from step 2>
   GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<from step 2>
   CG_SESSION_SECRET=<any long random string, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=<your deployment's public URL, no trailing slash>
   ```
4. Restart/redeploy. A "Sign in with GitHub" link appears in the header and a "My GitHub" tab appears on the Start Indexing page automatically once all three of `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` / `CG_SESSION_SECRET` are set — no other config needed, and nothing changes for anyone if you leave them unset.

### Locking the whole app to your account (`CG_OWNER_GITHUB_LOGIN`)
By default, once GitHub sign-in is configured, repos indexed anonymously still land in a shared public bucket anyone can see/index into — sign-in only makes *your own* repos private. To instead make the **entire deployment** (every page, every API route) usable only by you:

1. Complete the GitHub sign-in setup above first (`CG_OWNER_GITHUB_LOGIN` fails closed with a 500 if OAuth isn't fully configured — it never silently opens the app back up).
2. Set `CG_OWNER_GITHUB_LOGIN=<your-github-username>` (comma-separate multiple logins for a small team, e.g. `alice,bob`).
3. Restart/redeploy. Now:
   - An anonymous visitor hitting any page is redirected to GitHub sign-in; any API route returns `401`.
   - A visitor signed in with a GitHub account **not** on the allowlist gets a static "Access Restricted" page (pages) or a `403` (API) — never a redirect loop.
   - `GET /api/health` and the GitHub OAuth routes themselves (`/api/auth/github*`) always stay reachable, so health checks and the sign-in flow that satisfies this very check never get blocked by it.
4. This is enforced once, in `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js's middleware entry point) — no individual route needed changes, and it applies uniformly to pages, `/api/repos`, `/api/index`, `/api/settings/*`, the AI Assistant routes, everything.

**What this grants**: the OAuth scope requested is `repo read:user` — GitHub's classic OAuth has no finer-grained read-only scope, so this is full read/write access to the signed-in user's repos (needed to clone private ones at all) plus their public profile. The token is held only in an encrypted, `httpOnly` session cookie — never written to disk, never returned in any API response, and only ever sent back to `github.com` itself (see `lib/session.ts` and the `runJob` host check in `lib/store.ts`).

## AI Assistant setup (optional — two independent backends)
Adds a chat panel to the Editor tab. Either backend, both, or neither may be configured; if both are, a small selector in the panel lets you switch (starting a fresh conversation with the new backend). Fully optional and off by default; skip this section if you don't need either.

Configuration lives in two places that stack: env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CG_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL`/`CG_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL`/`CG_LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY`, `CG_CLAUDE_MODEL`) set a deployment-wide default, and the in-app **Settings page** (`/settings`) lets any signed-in user override them for themselves without touching the deployment's environment. **A value saved through the Settings page is scoped to the GitHub account that saved it** (`settings` table's `PRIMARY KEY (key, user_id)`) — never visible to, or overwritable by, a different signed-in account, and never falls back to another account's saved value. If GitHub sign-in (above) isn't configured at all, or a visitor isn't signed in, Settings changes go to a single shared "no account" bucket instead — the same single-shared-config behavior as before this scoping existed, appropriate for a self-hosted single-operator instance.

### Claude (Claude Agent SDK)
Runs in-process against the repo's live workspace directory.

1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>` on the deployment (and/or in a local `.env.local` for dev). Restart/redeploy.
2. `npm install` already pulls the correct platform binary via `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `optionalDependencies` (Linux glibc/musl x64+arm64, macOS, Windows), so this works in the Docker image with no extra install step.
3. **Subscription mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` / "Use my Claude subscription" toggle) requires real evidence of a working login on this exact server process** — either `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` set as an env var, or a `~/.claude/.credentials.json` file from having run `claude login` on that same host. On Render (and most container hosts), the home directory is NOT on the persistent disk and there's no interactive terminal to run `claude login` in the first place, so a credentials file can never exist there — `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is the only way subscription mode can work on this deployment model. CodeGraph checks for this evidence server-side (`claudeSubscriptionCredentialsAvailable()` in `lib/settings.ts`) before ever offering Claude via the subscription path — toggling the Settings checkbox alone, with no real credentials, correctly leaves the Claude tab unavailable instead of producing a broken chat session ("Not logged in — Please run /login", followed by "/login isn't available in this environment", since the SDK session is headless and can't prompt interactively).

### Local model (any OpenAI-compatible server)
Talks over plain HTTP to a model server running on your own hardware — no data leaves the machine running CodeGraph. Tested against the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` shape that Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp's `server`, vLLM, and text-generation-webui all implement; tool-calling quality (and therefore how well the assistant can actually edit files) depends entirely on the model you pick — recent tool-calling-tuned models (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder, Llama 3.1+) work noticeably better than older/small ones.

1. Start your model server and note its OpenAI-compatible base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama, `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio.
2. Set `CG_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` and `CG_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` on the deployment (and/or in a local `.env.local` for dev). Restart/redeploy.
3. If running CodeGraph itself in Docker while the model server runs on the host, point `CG_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` at the host (e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` on Docker Desktop) rather than `localhost`, which inside the container means the container itself.

### Both backends
An "AI Assistant" icon appears in the Editor tab's activity bar automatically once at least one backend is configured — no other config needed, and nothing changes for anyone if you leave both unset.

**What this grants**: nothing beyond the app's own workspace tools, for either backend. The assistant gets zero built-in Claude Code tools (`tools: []`, `strictMcpConfig: true`, `settingSources: []` in `lib/agents/assistant.ts`) and the local-model path has no built-in tools to begin with — no Bash, no raw filesystem access, no project settings/hooks/plugins, for either. Both backends' only capabilities are the same nine tools (`lib/agents/workspaceToolImpls.ts`), thin wrappers over the exact path-safe helpers the human-facing Editor already uses (`lib/workspace.ts`'s `resolveSafe`-guarded fs ops, `lib/gitops.ts`'s argv-only git wrapper) — the same traversal/injection guarantees apply regardless of which model is driving the chat. Sessions are per-repo, in-process, and never written to disk (`persistSession: false` for Claude; the local backend never had a disk-persistence path to begin with); a server restart drops all AI Assistant conversation history with no cleanup required.

- `GET /api/health` → `{ status: "ok", localAccessAllowed }` (200). Use for LB/Docker/K8s probes. Deliberately excludes `uptime`/timestamps — unauthenticated reconnaissance value with no legitimate client use.
- Jobs are persisted in SQLite; a crashed indexing job is retriable by re-submitting.
- Indexing runs in-process (fire-and-forget). For high throughput, front with a queue (future work).

## Security notes
- Anonymous git URLs must be public; `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` prevents credential prompts. A signed-in GitHub user (see above) can additionally clone their own private repos, authenticated with their own OAuth token — never anyone else's.
- Repo URL is validated (`^https?://…`) and SSRF-guarded (rejects loopback/private/link-local hosts, see `lib/urlSafety.ts`) before use; clone runs with a timeout + output cap.
- Local-folder indexing is **off by default on a public deployment** (`CG_ALLOW_LOCAL_ACCESS`) — self-hosted/trusted-host use only; never turn it on for untrusted visitors on a shared host.
- No secrets are required for the core product — the agent swarm is deterministic and needs **no LLM API key**. GitHub sign-in (needs a secret) and the two optional AI Assistant backends (Claude needs a secret; the local-model backend needs no secret at all — it's just an HTTP call to hardware you already control) are the only opt-in extras; everything else runs with zero credentials.

## Scaling path (documented, not yet implemented)
1. Move indexing to a worker queue (Redis/BullMQ) — API stays; `store.createIndexJob` enqueues.
2. Swap SQLite → Postgres (`pgvector`) via the same `store` interface for multi-tenant scale + real embeddings.
3. Incremental re-index on webhooks (only changed files re-parsed).

## CI checklist
```bash
npm run test         # vitest unit tests (engines)
npm run build        # typecheck + standalone build
```

## Backup / restore
- State is a single file: `data/codegraph.sqlite` (+ `-wal`, `-shm`). Back up the `data` volume.
- Restore by placing the file back and restarting.

## Built-in editor workspaces
- Indexing a **git** repo now clones it into `data/workspaces/<repoId>/` (depth 50, all branches) instead of a disposable temp dir, so the Editor tab has a live working tree to read/write/commit against. This lives on the same persistent disk as the SQLite DB — bump `disk.sizeGB` in `render.yaml` (or the `codegraph-data` volume) if you index many/large repositories.
- Deleting a git-sourced repo removes its `workspaces/<repoId>` directory. Deleting a **local**-sourced repo never touches disk — its "workspace" is the user's real folder passed in at index time.
- The remediation executor (`/api/repos/:id/fix`) is unaffected: it still clones into a disposable `os.tmpdir()` sandbox and removes it when done.
